# Parley

Programming language for the 21th century.

## Smart defaults

Make programming language expressive and performant at the expense of being
familiar.

### Parallel by default

Expressions run in parallel, unless there are data dependencies. Determine
size of threadpools during compile time.

### Immutable by default

Data parallelism is largely possible due to immutable data structures.
